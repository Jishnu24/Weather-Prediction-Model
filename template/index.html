      <h2>About Rain Prediction Model</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">The Rain Prediction Model is a web application powered by a Machine 
        Learning algorithm, designed to forecast whether it will rain the following day. Developed using the Rain Prediction in 
        Australia dataset, the model operates behind the scenes to provide accurate predictions. The project's code repository 
        can be accessed on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Jishnu24/Weather-Prediction" style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">here</a>. 
        Australia experiences varying rainfall patterns, with over 80% of its landmass receiving less than 600 mm of rainfall annually,
        making it one of the driest continents after Antarctica. Inland areas, such as those near Lake Eyre, may receive as little as
        81 mm of rain annually, while the Australian desert typically sees rainfall ranging from 81 to 250 mm per year. 
        Thunderstorms occur frequently in some regions, averaging between 15 to 20 per year. Southern Australia is influenced by 
        westerly winds and rain-bearing cold fronts during winter, while summers are characterized by dry heat with occasional 
        coastal sea breezes. Dry spells in southern and eastern states can lead to bushfires, particularly in Victoria and New South
        Wales, fueled by hot, dry interior winds. Northern Australia experiences a wet summer due to the monsoon season, typically 
        from October to April, bringing humid north-westerly winds and frequent showers and thunderstorms. Tropical cyclones can 
        also bring heavy rainfall to coastal regions, extending further inland.

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here I have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
        account. So to see the visualizations interactive I am attaching my <a href="../static/rain.pbix" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">PowerBI</a>
        dashboard file. This requires PowerBI software to open the file. The usage of dashboards like
        these is to bring a better understanding about the dataset and also to bring some beautiful insights</p>
